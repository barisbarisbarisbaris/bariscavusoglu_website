        Barış Çavuşoğlu (b. 1994) is a visual artist specializing as an animator and sculptor. 
        They started their academic studies in 3D Visual Effects at Escape Studios in London and later 
        earned a BSc in Computer Science with Games Technology from City, University of London. In 2018, 
        Çavuşoğlu relocated to Berlin and became a member of Random Collective, an organization dedicated 
        to animation and design. The following year, they moved to Los Angeles to pursue an MFA in Experimental 
        Animation at California Institute of the Arts and graduated in 2023. 
        Their work has gained international recognition, with their animations being showcased at 
        venues and festivals at the likes of Annecy International Animation Film Festival, REDCAT 
        Theatre, OVNi Festival France, Lithuanian International Shorts, Heavy Manners Library 
        Los Angeles and Dutch Design Week. In addition to their exhibitions and personal projects, 
        they have worked as a freelance animation director for Adult Swim, contributing to the 
        network's eclectic content. In November 2021, Çavuşoğlu collaborated with Kid Xanthrax 
        on a dual presentation titled #SLIPGNOSIS at BSMNT Leipzig, Germany. The following year, 
        they debuted their first solo exhibition, Hit Me Baby One More Time, at Barın Han in Istanbul. 
        In 2024, they followed up with a second solo exhibition, RTV-2 HRPgül, held at the Ritz-Carlton 
        in Istanbul. Currently based in Istanbul, Barış Çavuşoğlu continues to develop a singular and 
        loud style fusing grotesque cartooning with non-linear narrative structures, expressed through 
        video art, sculptures and installations.<br>
